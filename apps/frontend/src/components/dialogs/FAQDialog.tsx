                    DraftGap is a tool to help you pick the best champion for
                    each situation. In the table, you can see all possible
                    champions to pick, and their winrates when picked in this
                    teamcomp.

                <p class="font-body">
                    DraftGap analyzes a couple of statistics, the base winrates
                    of champions, the winrates of duo's within each team and
                    every matchup between the two teams. It calulates the
                    winrate of each team comp after picking a possible champion,
                    and shows this in the table. This method is based of the

                    Does DraftGap have any shortcomings?
                </h2>
                <p class="font-body">
                    DraftGap is not perfect, and there are several things to
                    keep in mind. The overall team comp identity is not taken
                    into account. The synergy of duos within a team are used in
                    the calculations, but the tool does not know about team comp
                    identity like 'engage' or 'poke'. We also do not look at the
                    damage composition (but it is shown, above the team
                    winrate), so you need to keep this in mind on you own.
                    <br />
                    These shortcomings result from the fact that there is not
                    enough data to make a perfect prediction. And I do not want
                    to incorporate opinions like 'malphite is an engage
                    champion' into the tool, as using just data is the most
                    objective way to make a decision.

                <p class="font-body">
                    The risk level is a measure of how much to trust small
                    sample sizes in the data. The higher the risk level, the
                    more it will recommend duos/matchups that have a small
                    sample size, and thus could be inaccurate. On the other
                    hand, it will also recommend more niche duos/counters that
                    are not seen often, but could be very strong.
