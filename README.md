# DraftGap
DraftGap.com is a site and desktop application which helps you pick and draft your League of Legends team. It suggests champions based on the meta, their matchups with every opponent champion and every ally duo. Its a unopinionated tool using only statistics to make suggestions.

If you ever wondered what champion to pick, which is the best champion you could have picked, or if the game was truly lost in draft, DraftGap is for you.

Find it at [draftgap.com](https://draftgap.com), or download the app, which integrates with the League client to automatically synchronize with the current draft in champ select.
